This is a version of the popular game Snake, implemented in pygame.

If you want to play, you just need to clone this code and execute the snake.py file.
A window will open, where you need to press Enter to start playing.
The goal is to make your snake (the black square) get bigger by eating the food (the red square).
You can navigate your snake by using the arrow keys.
If you try to run through the edges of the game window or you try to run through your own snake, you lose.
If you manage to stay in the game until the snake fills out the entire game window, you win.
